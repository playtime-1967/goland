## Designing Bulk Payments for How Businesses Really Work

1. **Origination**
   Published on **28 May 2025**, Monzo shares the story behind building a **bulk payments** feature into their Business Banking Team plan, addressing real business needs and enhancing efficiency. ([Monzo][1])

2. **Why Bulk Payments?**
   Businesses frequently expressed frustration over manually making multiple payments (e.g., payroll, suppliers). Monzo identified this as a crucial pain point and built the case by estimating market demand beyond their existing customer base. ([Monzo][1])

3. **Deep User Research**

   * Monzo conducted in-depth **user interviews** to understand current workflows.
   * They created **user journey maps** to visualize customer interactions, emotions, and pain points.
   * They also conducted **UX competitor teardowns**, evaluated solutions, identified gaps, and researched what Monzo could do—including their unique "magic." ([Monzo][1])

4. **Quantitative Analysis**
   Data uncovered:

   * How long businesses take to make payments
   * Frequency (weekly/monthly)
   * Platform preference (web preferred for bulk uploads; mobile for approvals)
     These insights shaped product design by highlighting where workflows were inefficient. ([Monzo][1])

5. **Phased, Lean Design Approach**

   * Monzo created a **high-level vision** for bulk payments and then broke it into **phased, iteratable features**.
   * Early **low-fidelity wireframes** helped gather rapid feedback from teammates and leadership. ([Monzo][1])

6. **Key Challenges & Solutions**

   * **Approval flows & access control**: Ensuring that collaborators initiate payments, while admins approve critical actions like payroll.
   * **Scaling payment checks**: Extending features like confirm-payee validations across multiple payments.
   * **Cross-platform UX**: Balancing CSV uploads (web) against quick approvals (mobile), ensuring a seamless experience across both. ([Monzo][1])

7. **Beta Testing & Launch**

   * They selected **beta testers** from early research groups to validate real-world usability.
   * Initial tests showed successful end-to-end flows (setup, scheduling, approval, execution) with only minor bugs resolved swiftly.
   * The feature launched alongside the Team plan. ([Monzo][1])

8. **Impact to Date**

   * Retention on the Team plan is at **\~70%**, with minimal negative feedback.
   * Average bulk payment contains **21–24 items**, saving businesses roughly **10 minutes** per batch (excluding file prep). ([Monzo][1])

9. **Key Learnings**

   * **User-centric design matters**—observe behaviors, don’t just ask.
   * **Cross-functional collaboration** (design, engineering, compliance) accelerates focused, high-impact delivery.
   * **Design and iterate continuously**—product design is an ongoing conversation.
   * **Leverage data and feedback** to guide decisions.
   * **Be adaptable and bold**—plan for uncertainties, and iterate quickly to resolve blockers. ([Monzo][1])

---

**In essence**: Monzo built the Bulk Payments feature not just as a transactional tool, but as an outcome of deep research, data-informed design, and phased delivery—all centered around real business needs.
