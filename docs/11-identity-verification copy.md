## Making Identity Verification More Accessible

1. enhancements to its ID verification process to improve accessibility for all, especially people with disabilities  

2. **Accessibility Matters**
   Around **1 in 7 people in the UK** have a disability that affects how they use the Monzo app. Monzo's mission—"Make money work for everyone"—means ensuring everyone can manage money independently, from account opening to everyday tasks  

3. **Recognizing the Problem**
   Shared feedback and collaboration with accessibility experts (Hassell Inclusion) revealed that the selfie-video step in identity verification posed barriers. Users with low vision, BSL users, or neurodivergent individuals found the process challenging  

4. **Brainstorming the Solution**

   * The idea was born during **Monzo’s Hackathon Week**, where a Product Designer partnered with Monzo’s Accessibility & Inclusion Manager.
   * They started with the hypothesis:
     *“By giving better feedback during selfie videos, we can help more people successfully complete IDV, particularly those with accessibility needs.”*  

5. **Prototyping with Users**
   Early-stage prototypes were tested with people who are visually impaired, communicate in BSL, or are neurodivergent. This highlighted needs around sentence clarity, sensory respite, and anxiety triggers during the process  

6. **Accessibility Enhancements Implemented**

   * **UI Improvements**: Added a frame with a dimmed background to highlight face placement and boost contrast for low vision users.
   * **Image Blur**: Introduced a fade-in effect from blurred to sharp, helping those sensitive to sudden changes or bright lights.
   * **Face Detection**: Ensures video recording only begins when the face is in view—no blurry or misplaced shots.
   * **Live Feedback**: Guidance cues like “move closer”, “centre your face”, with added **colour and haptic feedback** to foster better framing.
   * **Inclusivity Messaging**: UI now clearly supports sign language and other non-verbal communication options  

7. **Results & Next Steps**

   * The improvements resulted in a **73% reduction in selfie-video errors**, meaning more users could sign up independently  
   * Monzo emphasized: **“Designing for inclusivity is good design that drives business impact.”**
   * Future plans include adding a **record timer** and updating the displayed phrase to numbers—based on BSL user feedback.
   * They also developed an **accessibility learning resource** for Product Designers to embed accessible thinking throughout future features
