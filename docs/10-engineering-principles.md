## We’ve Updated Our Engineering Principles

1. A refreshed set of engineering principles to **better reflect their current ethos** and support decision-making, collaboration, and culture at scale.

2. **Why the update?** As Monzo’s engineering organization has evolved, so have their values. They wanted their principles to be more than words—a practical framework that inspires, guides, and nurtures engineers.   

3. **Updated Principles:**

   * **Make changes small, make them often**
     Emphasizes speedy, incremental deployments that are easier to review, safer, and easier to revert when issues arise.   

   * **Unblock others whenever you can**
     Prioritize helping peers—be it reviewing a PR or offering feedback—as a high-impact activity that builds collective momentum.   

   * **Leave things better than you found them**
     Encourage continuous, incremental improvements across code, documentation, and process—no contribution is too small.   

   * **Optimize for impact-to-effort ratio**
     Encourage doing the most valuable work possible without chasing perfection; small, high-impact actions matter.   

   * **Take ownership of problems**
     Empower engineers to drive solutions proactively—even outside their immediate role—through analysis, experimentation, or design mockups.   

   * **Make technical investments that increase our velocity**
     Advocate for investing time in tooling or automation (especially if it saves future effort), ideally time-boxed to assess impact.   

   * **Consider reversibility of decisions**
     Move fast—but when stakes are high, ensure decisions are reversible or fail-safe.   

   * **Design systems to prevent misuse**
     Build secure defaults and simplicity in interfaces; anticipate misuse and mitigate it proactively to protect customer data and funds.   

   * **Think global first**
     Build with multiple products (personal/business/joint) and markets in mind—easy things like copy are easy to adjust later; harder things (data models) should be designed with global scale in mind.   

   * **Consider tests as the foundations of our product**
     Designing testability from the outset ensures faster, safer development and higher confidence in shipping quality products.   

4. **Context**
   These principles offer tangible, actionable guidance for everyday work at Monzo: from code quality to security, collaboration, and system design—helping engineers make better choices quickly.   

---

**In essence**: Monzo’s revised engineering principles emphasize speed, collaboration, iterative improvement, ownership, safety, global thinking, and testability—empowering engineers to build with confidence and scale sustainably.
